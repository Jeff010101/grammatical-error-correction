I would first like to thank my thesis advisor [title] [Name Surname] of the [School / Faculty name] at [University name]. The door to Prof. [Last name] office was always open whenever I get into a trouble or had a question about my research or writing. 

I would also like to thank the experts who were involved in the validation survey for this research project: [List professional Titles, Name and Surnames of the experts who participated/contributed]. Without their passionate participation and input, the validation survey could not have been successfully conducted.
